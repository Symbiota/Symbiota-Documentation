Standard: Location,Security,"Selecting `Locality Security applied` from the dropdown meny will hide locality details below the level of county from unauthorized users. This is typically done because the species is rare or threatened, or because the collection location is private. Images or other media are also hidden to protect locality details that might be viewable from the label. Users that are logged into the system and have the necessary permission to view locality details (e.g. collection managers) will continue to have access to all data. Locality Security will automatically be applied if the species name is on a portal's Protected Species list (accessible via Sitemap). Selecting `Fully Security applied` will completely hide the record from all public users who do not have editor or administrator permissions for your collection. **Unless legal protections apply, this level of security is generally NOT recommended for most records, as it reduces the discoverability of your collections and obscures valuable data from research and public use.** Leaving the Security field at `Security not applied` will allow default settings to be applied as determined by the sensitive species administrators, which is the recommendation for most records.

Standard: Location,Uncertainty,"The accuracy of the georeference coordinates in meters (numeric value only). This is measured as the radius of a circle where the true point would be found if known.

While previously collected specimens that have coordinates on the label recorded by the collector typically do not state the source of the coordinates (GPS, map, etc), it is typically a good assumption that the coordinates are accurate within one to two hundred meters. If the locality details are vague such as just ""`Grand Canyon`, then the coordinates should be the centroid within the uncertainty encompassing the greater area where the specimen may have been collected. If the locality is `Boynton Canyon, Sedona`, the uncertainty would be about 1500 m.
