General instructions for editing records can be found in the [**Editor Guide**](/Editor_Guide/Editing_Searching_Records).

Collection managers (i.e., users with administrator permissions) can additionally [**conduct batch edits**](/Collection_Manager_Guide/Editing_Occurrences/) and [**delete records**](/Collection_Manager_Guide/deleting_records).
