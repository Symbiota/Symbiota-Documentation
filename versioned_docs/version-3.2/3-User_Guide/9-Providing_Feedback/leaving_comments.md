If you notice an issue or would like to ask a question about a particular occurrence in a Symbiota portal, you can leave a comment on that occurrence that will then be automatically emailed to the collection manager and, in some cases, the portal manager.

First, make sure you are logged in to your account. Any user can create an account by clicking New Account in the site menu.

Next, open the public display page of the record. To do so from the results of a search in "list display", click **Full Record Details** below the occurrence. To do so from the results of a search in "table display", click on the SymbiotaID number (far left column) of the occurrence. To do so from a map search, hover over the point, then click See Details.

From the public display page of the record, click the Comments tab, enter your comment, and click Submit Comment.

:::warning

Symbiota does not automatically associate your contact information with your comments on specimen records. If you would like to be contacted in response to your comment, please include your name and contact information to assist the collections administrator with reaching out.
