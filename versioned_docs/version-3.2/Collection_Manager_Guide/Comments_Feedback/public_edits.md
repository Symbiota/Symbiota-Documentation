This page describes how any Symbiota user can suggest modifications to an occurrence record. This can be a useful feature for community members to remediate data quality issues.

:::

### Enable Public Edits

The option to enabled public edits is managed on a **per-collection basis** and is activated through the [Collection Metadata Editor](/Collection_Manager_Guide/editing_collection_metadata#collections-metadata). Turn this on by navigating to the _Administration Control Panel > Edit Metadata_ and check the box for _Allow Public Edits_.

Once activated, any portal user who is logged in can suggest changes to your occurrence records using a paired-down version of the Occurrence Editor form. Public users cannot suggest edits to _Catalog Number_ or _Scientific Name_ values.

| Once Public Edits are enabled via the [Collection Metadata Editor](/Collection_Manager_Guide/editing_collection_metadata#collections-metadata), any user who is logged into the portal can suggest changes to individual occurrence records. |

### Review Public Edits

To review suggested changes made by public users:

1. Navigate to the _Administration Control Panel > Review/Verify Occurrence Edits_.
2. In the Filter panel, set _Applied Status_ = "Not Applied" and select _Submit Filter_ to filter out pending public edits to your occurence records.
3. Proceed to use the [Specimen Edit Reviewer](/Collection_Manager_Guide/Crowdsourcing/reviewing_crowdsourcing) to accept and reject suggested changes to your records.

### What do public portal users see?

Refer to the [User Guide](/User_Guide/Providing_Feedback/suggesting_edits) for more information.
