Providing feedback on specimen records can improve the quality of data available in a given Symbiota portal.

There are three main ways to provide feedback:
1. [Comment on a Record](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/user/public_feedback/comment/)
2. [Contact a Curator](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/user/public_feedback/contact/)
3. [Edit a Record](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/coll_manager/public_feedback/public_edits/) (only available for some collections)
