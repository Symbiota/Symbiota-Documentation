1. Use the Sitemap to navigate to the Geographic Thesaurus under "Administrative Functions (Super Admins only)".
2. If the geographic unit you are editing is a root term, select the term from the list on the resulting page. If the geographic unit is not a root term, use the Search Geographic Thesaurus box to search for your term.

:::note

The search box will show a dropdown list of all terms matching your search term, along with the parent unit of your search term. Make sure you select the correct unit+parent unit combo!

3. To edit the values in the Geographic Unit box, click the pencil icon (highlighted below), make any edits, and click the Save Edits button. This is also where you can change the parent geographic unit for this unit (see Parent term field) and the preferred/accepted term for this unit (see Preferred term field).

6. To add a child term, click the plus icon at the top of the "children" list and follow [the instructions here](/docs/Portal_Manager_Guide/Geographic_Thesaurus/adding_geographic_units).
