There are several ways to add occurrence records, depending on your level of permissions. Editors can add specimens as [skeletal records](/docs/Editor_Guide/Adding_Records/adding_skeletal_records), as [full records](/docs/Editor_Guide/Adding_Records/adding_full_records), and by [uploading an image](/docs/Editor_Guide/Adding_Records/adding_records_images).
