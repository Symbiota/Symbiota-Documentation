:::info

This page describes how to view comments on your occurrences. Any Symbiota user can create a comment on an occurrence record. This can be a useful feature for community members to ask questions or flag data quality issues.

:::

To view and vet comments posted on records from your collection, navigate to the Administration Control Panel: _My Profile > Occurrence Management > name of collection_ and click “View Posted Comments.” If there is no orange text to the right of this option, you have no comments that have not yet been reviewed.

On the Comments Listing page, you can:

- hide comments from the public (in cases of sensitive or personal data)
- mark comments as reviewed (i.e., you have resolved the issue described by the comment)
- delete comments (in cases of spam or inappropriate content)
- view specimen records associated comments by selecting the URLs above comment details (catalog number, collector, collector number, and date)

In the event that you have many comments to work through, you use the _Filter Options_ box (top right) to view only comments that were posted by a certain user, have a certain status (public/non-public/reviewed), or were posted within a certain date range.

:::note

⚠️ Spam comments are so far rare, but one should regularly review posted comments to ensure no inappropriate content has been posted to your collection. **If you find any inappropriate comments**, please contact the portal manager immediately so they can remove this user from the portal.
