Specimens will remain in the crowdsourcing queue until their processing status has been changed from "unprocessed". Use the [occurrence editor](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/editor/edit/) or the [Batch Editor tool](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/coll_manager/edit/batch/) to change the processing status of the specimen or specimens that you would like removed from the queue.
