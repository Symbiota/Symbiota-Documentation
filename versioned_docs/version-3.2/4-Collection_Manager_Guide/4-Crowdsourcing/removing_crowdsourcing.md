Specimens will remain in the crowdsourcing queue until their processing status has been changed from "unprocessed". Use the [occurrence editor](/docs/Editor_Guide/Editing_Searching_Records/) or the [Batch Editor tool](/docs/Collection_Manager_Guide/Editing_Occurrences/batch_editing) to change the processing status of the specimen or specimens that you would like removed from the queue.
