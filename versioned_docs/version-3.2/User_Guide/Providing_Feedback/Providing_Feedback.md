Providing feedback on specimen records can improve the quality of data available in a given Symbiota portal.

There are three main ways to provide feedback:
1. [Comment on a Record](leaving_comments)
2. [Contact a Collection Curator](contacting_collection)
3. [Edit a Record](suggesting_edits) (only available for some collections)
