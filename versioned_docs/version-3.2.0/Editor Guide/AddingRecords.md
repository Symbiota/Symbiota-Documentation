There are several ways to add occurrence records, depending on your level of permissions. Editors can add specimens as [skeletal records](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/editor/add/skeletal/), as [full records](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/editor/add/full/), and by [uploading an image](https://biokic.github.io/symbiota-docs/editor/add/image/).
