:::info

This page describes how you can package your data as a Darwin Core Archive (standard format for data publishing and sharing) in a Symbiota portal.

:::

A [Darwin Core Archive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Core_Archive) (DwC-A) is a data standard that is commonly used to package species occurrence data into a single, self-contained dataset. A DwC-A includes metadata, a file of occurrence data, and, often, files for determinations (identifications), multimedia, and any other data extensions.

:::note

You can only publish a Darwin Core Archive of occurrences that have unique occurrence IDs and GUIDs. In your [collection metadata page](/Collection_Manager_Guide/editing_collection_metadata), make sure that you have selected a source for your GUID and that this source contains unique values for each occurrence.

:::

1. Navigate to your Administration Control Panel (My Profile > Occurrence Management > name of your collection).
2. Click Darwin Core Archive Publishing.
3. Click the Create/Refresh Darwin Core Archive button.
