As an editor, your primary mechanism of downloading data is to use the [public search and download tools](/User_Guide/Downloading/download_data). For more specialized searches, contact an administrator of your collection so they can use the [Exporter Tool](/Collection_Manager_Guide/Downloading/downloading_subset).

Alternatively, you can download the entire Darwin Core Archive of your data (through the public search or [these instructions](/Editor_Guide/Downloading_Data/downloading_darwin_core_archive)) and conduct a search in the occurrences.csv file using a spreadsheet editor.
