This page describes how to transfer media resources to other records in your collection or how to delete media resources associated with a record.

:::

#### Transferring a Media Resource to Another Record

1. Navigate to the occurrence record that has the media resource you would like to transfer. (e.g., My Profile > Occurrence Management > name of collection > Edit Existing Occurrence Records > use record search form to find specific occurrence).
2. Open the occurrence record in the Occurrence Editor (see screenshot below).
3. Click the Media tab.

4. Click the pencil icon to the right of the media resource you would like to transfer.
5. If you would like to transfer the media resource to a brand new record, rather than a record that already exists, scroll down to the box labeled **Link to a New Blank Occurrence Record within Collection** and click the "Link to New Occurrence" button.
   - The SymbiotaID number associated with the new record you have created with the media resource will be displayed at the top of the page after you click this button. To navigate to that record, click the blue SymbiotaID number.
6. If you would like to transfer the media resource to a record that already exists, scroll down to the box labeled **Remap to Another Specimen**.
7. You can either enter the SymbiotaID number for the record (if you have it on hand) or use the Occurrence Linking Aid (where you can search by catalog number, collector, and/or collector number). To do the latter, click "Open Occurrence Linking Aid" to the right of the field.
8. In the pop-up window, enter the search terms you would like to use to find the occurrence to which you would like to link the media resource. You can include several terms in this search concurrently. Then click the Search Occurrences button to see the search results.
9. If there are results of your search, they will be listed below the **Voucher Search Pane** as shown below. To select one of the listed occurrences for linking, click Select Occurrence Record. This will close the window and import that record's SymbiotaID number into the **Remap to Another Specimen** panel.
   - If you don't find the record you are looking for, try using different search terms. If the record does not exist, you can click the Create New Occurrence button to create a brand new occurrence for the media resource.

10. Back on the Media tab of the Occurrence Editor page, click the Remap Resource button.

:::note

Any data associated with that media resource (e.g., its catalog number) will NOT be transferred along with the media resource. You will need to copy over this information in another way, if applicable.

#### Deleting a Media Resource

1. Complete steps 1-4 in the instructions above.
2. Scroll down to the box labeled **Delete Resource**.
   - If your media resources are stored on Symbiota Support Hub servers (i.e., you upload them via Globus or directly through the Media tab), check the "Remove resource from server" box. Otherwise, leave this box unchecked.
   - If your media resources are stored on another server, such as an institutional server, leave the "Remove resource from server" box unchecked.
