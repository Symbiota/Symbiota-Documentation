:::info

This page provides instructions for bulk uploading specimen determinations/annotations and associating them with their respective specimen records. For instructions for adding individual determinations or the batch annotation tool, see [this page](/Editor_Guide/Editing_Searching_Records/annotations/). This tool can only be accessed by a superadministrator.

:::

:::tip

**If you are new to using this tool**, try importing only a few new determinations to familiarize yourself with how the tool behaves before ingesting a large batch. For instance, **this tool cannot be used to overwrite existing determinations**; it can only be used to add new determinations to one or more occurrence records.

| Data associated with specimen identifications (aka taxonomic determinations or annotations) can be added to specimen records in bulk using the **Extended Data Importer** tool. |

### Initiating the Upload

1. Navigate to your Administration Control Panel (_My Profile > Occurrence Management > name of your collection_).
2. Within the Administration Control Panel, navigate to _Import/Update Specimen Records > Extended Data Import_.
3. Select the file containing your determinations to be imported. See below for tips regarding the contents and formatting of this file.
4. Choose _Import Type_ = "Determinations".
5. Select the desired Upload Type from the dropdown menu.
6. If your upload was successful, the message "Done process input file" will appear in the Action Panel.

#### Example Data Import File

Files containing determinations to be bulk imported must be in CSV format and include the following: 1) an identifier for the associated specimen occurrence (_catalogNumber_, _otherCatalogNumber_, or _occurrenceID_), 2) _dateIdentified_, 3) _identifiedBy_, and 4) _sciname_.

For example:

| catalogNumber | identifiedBy   | dateIdentified | sciname                      |
| ------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| OBI000001     | Don Cole       | 1950           | Rosa woodsii var. gratissima |
| OBI000001     | unknown        | s.d.           | Rosa                         |
| OBI000002     | Edward Gilbert | 2023-10-01     | Rosa woodsii                 |

### Data Import Fields

:::tip

Refer to the [Symbiota Data Fields](/Editor_Guide/Editing_Searching_Records/symbiota_data_fields) and [Data Import Fields](/Collection_Manager_Guide/Importing_Uploading/data_import_fields) guides for more information about some of the fields listed below.

:::

:::tip

Not all fields available through the Extended Data Importer for bulk determination ingestion are visible through the Occurrence Editor interface. However, once imported, these values can be exported, for example, through a [data backup](/Collection_Manager_Guide/Downloading/downloading_copy).
