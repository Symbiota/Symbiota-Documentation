![Personal Observation Profile Options](/img/persobsoptions.jpg)

* **Search Records:** search through the records that you have entered into this profile. You can conduct custom, detailed searches from this interace. Tutorial information can be found [on this page](/Editor_Guide/Editing_Searching_Records).
* **Add a New Record:** tutorials for [adding records here](/Editor_Guide/Adding_Records/adding_full_records) and for [editing records here](/Editor_Guide/Editing_Searching_Records)
* **Print Labels:** print labels for specimens of all types, including specimen packets. [Tutorials here](/Editor_Guide/Label_Customization/).
* **Print Annotation Labels:** print annotation/determination/identification labels for specimens that already have full labels. [Tutorials here](/Editor_Guide/Label_Customization/annotation_label_printing).
* **Submit image-vouchered observation:** use an image to create a new record, if you did not collect a specimen for the record. The available data entry fields are similar to those used to add a new specimen record (see above).
* **Review/Verify Occurrence Edits:** view, revert, or apply edits that you have made to your records. [Tutorial here](/Collection_Manager_Guide/reviewing_edits).
* **Download backup file (CSV extract):** download a copy of your data to review or send to a collection. CSV files may be opened in Excel or a similar spreadsheet software.
* **View User Comments:** because your data are publicly visible, users may leave comments on your records. Use this tool to view and manage those comments. See [this page](/Collection_Manager_Guide/Comments_Feedback/public_comments) for more information.
