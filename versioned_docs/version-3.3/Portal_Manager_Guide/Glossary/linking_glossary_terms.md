:::note

Only users with Superadministrator or Identification Keys Administrator permissions may add or edit terms in the glossary.

:::

Glossary terms can be linked to both characters and character states used in [identification keys](/User_Guide/Identification_Keys) to help define these characters and character states.

Glossary terms can be linked in the same interface used to edit and add characters and character states. Instructions for doing so [can be found here](/User_Guide/Identification_Keys/admin).
