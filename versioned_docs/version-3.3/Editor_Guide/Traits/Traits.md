Occurrence traits can be scored and stored in some Symbiota portals (e.g., the [CCH2](https://cch2.org/portal/), which contains phenological trait data for vascular plants).

Traits are stored in a separate table than the main occurrence data and can be viewed for an occurrence in the Traits tab in the Occurrence Editor. 

Traits can often be downloaded along with occurrence data as an [extended measurementOrFact file](https://tools.gbif.org/dwca-validator/extension.do?id=http://rs.iobis.org/obis/terms/ExtendedMeasurementOrFact).

Several tools have been developed to enable users to annotate specimen records for their traits, including the [Trait Coding from Images](/Editor_Guide/Traits/trait_scoring_images) tool and the [Trait Coding from Text](/Editor_Guide/Traits/trait_scoring_text) tool. The traits available to score vary between portals, and new traits can be developed as needed (contact your portal administrator for more information).
