This page describes some workflows for batch uploading images or other media resources into a Symbiota portal.

:::

Symbiota databases do not physically store media resources such as images, rather, they store links to where media resources can be accessed via the web. For this reason, there are many ways that media resources can be linked to occurrence records in the portal. Any storage solution that can provide a web-accessible URL to an media resource can be used to link images to occurrences in a Symbiota portal.

#### Media Storage through the Symbiota Support Hub

For collections with little capacity to host their own media resources, the Symbiota Support Hub (SSH) may be able to host web-ready versions (e.g., jpegs, for image files) of media resources for access via a Symbiota portal. In this case, media resources (largely images) are uploaded to Globus and transferred to SSH-managed servers. The URLs generated by these servers are then linked to your records in a Sybmiota portal. To determine whether this is possible for your collection, contact the [Symbiota Support Hub](mailto:help@symbiota.org).

#### Media Storage through an Institutional Server

If your institution has the ability to serve media resources in a web-accessible format, these URLs can be easily linked to their occurrences in your portal through a batch processing script. Contact your portal administrator or the Symbiota Support Hub for more information or to set up this workflow.
