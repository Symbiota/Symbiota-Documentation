#### Welcome to the Editor Guide!

This guide contains instructions for users with **Editor** permissions for a collection in a Symbiota site.

Users with Administrator permissions automatically inherit Editor permissions as well, but not vice versa, so much of this content pertains to Administrators as well.

Not sure what level of permissions you are working with? See the [User Permissions](/User_Guide/user_permissions) page.
