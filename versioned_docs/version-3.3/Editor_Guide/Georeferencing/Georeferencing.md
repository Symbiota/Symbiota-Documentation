**Georeferencing** is the process of assigning coordinates to generally textual descriptions of occurrence localities (e.g., the location where a specimen was collected). Some helpful resource about georeferencing can be found [on the iDigBio website](https://www.idigbio.org/wiki/index.php/Georeferencing). Symbiota includes several tools for facilitating this process:

- **Mapping tool**: view the map, place a point on the occurrence location, and assign an error radius
- **GEOLocate tool**: view a map (many layers available, including USGS Topo Maps, Open Street Maps, Bing Maps, and Leaflet maps), view auto-generated potential georeference points, edit point location and error radius
- **Coordinate cloning tool**: search for records with similar or identical locality information and import any coordinates associated with that locality
- **Duplicate specimen/locality data import**: search for records with identical or similar collector information or locality information and import any coordinates associated with the duplicate's locality
- [**Batch georeferencing**](/Editor_Guide/Georeferencing/batch_georeferencing): use the Leaflet maps, GEOLocate, and coordinate cloning tool in batch for a collection of specimens with similar/identical locality descriptions
- **Integration with GEOLocate Collaborative Georeferencing (CoGe)**: export records to [GEOLocate CoGe](https://coge.geo-locate.org/) to be collaboratively georeferenced using the GEOLocate web client
