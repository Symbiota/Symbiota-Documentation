:::info

This page defines "traits" in Symbiota portals and describes how they can be searched.

:::

:::note

Traits are not activated in all portals. At present, traits can only be set up on the back end, and not all portals include traits.

:::

In Symbiota portals, **traits** are defined as measurements or characteristics of specific records. This may include, for example, the phenology (e.g., life history stage) of the specimen, height, or mass. Symbiota portals currently only support categorical traits, not numerical traits (i.e., precise measurements, such as "40 g").

Records with certain traits can be searched in the [public search form](/User_Guide/searching_records) under the "Traits"  box.

:::warning

Trait data must exist before it can be searched! Not all portals include trait data, and not all records within a portal have values for all (or even any) traits. A lack of trait data should not be interpreted as a lack of trait measurements or the existence of those traits.
